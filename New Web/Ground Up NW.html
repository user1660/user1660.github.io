          The ultimate goal for any business is to achieve maximum success. This
          applies whether you're the sole owner of a young fledgling business, small
          business, SME's or a huge manufacturing business with many people
          sitting on the board. If you want to achieve this goal, several steps
          will have to be followed, and this is a business process.
