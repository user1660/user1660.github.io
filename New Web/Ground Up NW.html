          The ultimate goal for any business is to achieve maximum success.
          This applies whether you're the sole owner or a young fledgling business, small
          business, SME's or a huge manufacturing business with many people sitting
          on the board. If you want to achieve this goal, several steps will
          have to be followed, and this is the business process</pre></p1>

        The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership,
        broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses,
        or those with wider ownership or more formal structures,
        will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships.
        In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people
        will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.</pre></p2>
